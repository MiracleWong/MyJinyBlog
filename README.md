# JinyBlog
JinyBlog is a personal blog platform based on JavaWeb technology. The entire project is completely open source, so you can download and research it as you like. This project is also one of my practical projects to learn JavaEE technology, so if I have a better way of implementation, I will keep updating this project.

## Why JinyBlog?

I have also used some very famous blog platforms, such as WordPress, Hexo and other blog frameworks. 
It is true that they are all excellent works, but my personal server configuration is not high, running these blog frameworks is very difficult, and the response time is very long when completing some settings. I like blogging, but I do nâ€™t like being lost in the ocean of plug-ins and skins, which not only consumes my precious energy, but also makes me feel very uncomfortable. After learning the knowledge of JavaWeb, I was excited to realize that I now have the ability to complete a static page blog, which is different from the mainstream dynamic page blog. The static page blog has a faster access speed, which makes me very happy. In addition, the process of completing the entire blog project is a test in itself, and I look forward to it with enthusiasm.



## More Details

Since I just started learning about JavaEE and have not yet touched the Spring framework, this project was developed using Servlet as the back-end body.

Some content currently used:

1. HTML + CSS + JavaScript
2. jQuery
3. ajax
4. servlet
5. Mysql
6. Redis

I admit that the project still has very, very many shortcomings. I am still a student and I am constantly improving this project. If you are interested in this project, you can fork and clone this project, which is fully licensed. If you encounter some problems in the process of research, you can submit your issue on the issues page, I will definitely try my best to solve it! !
